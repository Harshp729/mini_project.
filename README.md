‚ÄúAI-Based Adaptive MCQ System‚Äù ‚Äî a smart exam platform that adjusts question difficulty in real-time based on user performance. The goal is to make online assessments more personalized, fair, and efficient. Instead of a one-size-fits-all test, this system adapts to the student's knowledge level during the exam, creating a tailored learning and evaluation experience.
Most traditional online tests follow a static structure where all users receive the same set of questions, regardless of their individual skill levels. This often leads to unfair evaluation ‚Äî some users find it too easy, while others find it too difficult. My project solves this by introducing adaptive testing logic that mimics human-like decision-making. It aims to support students in identifying their actual proficiency and encourages learning through progression.

üîπ Key Features
Adaptive Questioning: The test begins with a medium-level question. If the user answers correctly, the difficulty increases; if wrong, it decreases. This continues for a total of 10 questions.

User Authentication: Secure login/signup system for individual users.

Intro Page & Course Selection: After logging in, users view an introduction page and select from a list of available courses for the exam.

User Dashboard: Each user has a dashboard to view their past exam results, number of correct/wrong answers, and performance trends.
